Introduction
============

``title`` is a library to enable music information retrieval (MIR) and acoustical analyses on Indian classical music. It provides tools that build on available algorithms developed for western music to make them more suitable for the Indian music context. 
 
The library includes audio processing functions such as computation of pitch-track & conversion to cents, onsets (vocal and percussion), short-time autocorrelation, tempo, lay ratio, intermediate matra locations from given ‘sam’ annotations, etc; and also relevant plotting functions for appropriate visualization.

The current implementation has been developed in Python 3 (Python 2 is not sufficient) and tested on a linux machine running Ubuntu 18.04. It should work with Windows and Mac OS as well.
